# Contracts Directory

This project is a static documentation site built with Docusaurus, so there are no traditional API contracts needed. The site serves educational content for the AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

## Content Interface

The "interface" for this project is the Markdown content structure that follows the Docusaurus documentation format:

- Each curriculum week is represented as a Markdown file
- Files follow the naming convention: `week-{number}-{topic}.md`
- Content includes proper Docusaurus frontmatter for navigation and metadata
- Navigation structure is defined in `sidebars.js`

## Content Requirements

All content must adhere to the following specifications:

1. Technical accuracy for ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA frameworks
2. Follow the 4 Modules and 13 Weeks curriculum structure
3. Include executable code examples where applicable
4. Maintain pedagogical progression from basic to advanced concepts
